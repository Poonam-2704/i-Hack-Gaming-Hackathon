Enhanced Gaming Behavior Monitoring System
Project Description
The Enhanced Gaming Behavior Monitoring System is a Python-based project designed to address critical challenges in the Indian online gaming industry, such as fostering trust, transparency, responsible gaming, and ethical gameplay. It leverages blockchain technology for transparency, machine learning for game type prediction, and implements reward systems to promote responsible gaming behavior.

This project demonstrates how technology can solve problems like gaming addiction, consumer misconceptions, fraud, and data breaches, providing a safer and more engaging gaming experience.

Features
1. Blockchain for Transparency and Accountability
Implements a custom blockchain to log all gaming transactions.
Each transaction is securely recorded, providing an immutable and auditable ledger of activity.
Promotes consumer trust by ensuring data integrity.
2. Machine Learning for Game Type Prediction
Trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier on a dataset of gaming behavior to predict whether a game is skill-based or chance-based.
Provides insights into game types, helping distinguish legitimate gaming from gambling.
3. Responsible Gaming Reward System
Rewards players with points for responsible gaming behavior based on playtime and spending thresholds.
Encourages healthy gaming habits and reduces the risk of addiction.
4. Real-Time Alerts
Alerts users in real-time when their gaming activity (playtime or spending) exceeds safe thresholds.
Promotes self-regulation and helps prevent excessive gaming.
5. Visualization of Gaming Behavior
Uses Matplotlib to visually represent user behavior trends, including playtime, spending, and reward points.
Offers actionable insights into player behavior for monitoring and feedback.
How It Works

Simulated User Data:
A dataset of users' gaming activity (playtime, spending, age, game type) is analyzed.
The system can predict gaming behavior and classify games as skill-based or chance-based.

Blockchain Integration:
Transactions (e.g., reward points earned) are securely logged on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records.

Reward and Alert System:
Based on thresholds, users are rewarded or alerted in real-time, encouraging responsible gaming.

Behavior Visualization:
User gaming data is visualized in a stacked bar chart to track trends in playtime, spending, and rewards.

Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, hashlib
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Run the main script:
python main.py

Code Structure
Blockchain Class:
Implements a custom blockchain for secure transaction logging.

Machine Learning Model:
Uses GradientBoostingClassifier to predict game types (skill vs. chance).

Reward System:
Assigns reward points to users based on playtime and spending.

Real-Time Alerts:
Monitors user behavior and generates alerts for high activity.

Visualization:
Graphically represents user behavior trends using Matplotlib.

Example Output
1. Model Accuracy:
mathematica
Model Accuracy: 80.00%

2. Simulated User Analysis:
For a user with:
Playtime: 5 hrs
Spending: $50
Age: 30

The output may be:
Predicted Game Type: Skill-based Game
Great job! You earned 10 reward points for responsible gaming.
Alert: Gaming behavior is normal.
Transaction Logged: {'playtime': 5, 'spending': 50, 'reward_points': 10}
